# bill-splitter
A project offered by Front End Mentor to build a working tip/bill splitting calculator. Built with HTML, CSS and JS
this project was built based on the provided designs using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. The app is responsive and is meant to be displayed on 
laptops, desktops or screen sizes less than 375px wide. Any advice on how to improve my work is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
